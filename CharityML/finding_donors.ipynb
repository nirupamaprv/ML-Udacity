    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "- Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "> Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):\n",
    "- Real world application: Categorizing news, email spam detection, face recognition, sentiment analysis, medical diagnosis, digit recognition and weather prediction are just few of the popular use cases of Naive Bayes algorithm.\n",
    "- Strengths:  Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple \"probabilistic classifiers\" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. They are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. The advantage of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification. Also, with appropriate pre-processing, it is competitive in the domain of text categorization, with more advanced methods including support vector machines.\n",
    "- Weakness: A comprehensive comparison with other classification algorithms shows that Bayes classification is outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests.\n",
    "- Suitability: In this model, we need to categorize as potential donor or not. This is clearly similar to the applications mentioned like categorizing news, email spam detection, etc. Hence, it is suitable for teh rpoblem on hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting):\n",
    "- Real world application: Classification problems such as spam detection.\n",
    "- Strengths:  There are two major benefits of Ensemble models: better prediction and being a more stable model. The aggregate opinion of a multiple models is less noisy than other models. i.e. the model will be better with ensemble of models rather than individual. Ensemble model combines multiple ‘individual’ (diverse) models together and delivers superior prediction power. Decision trees can learn non-linear relationships, and are fairly robust to outliers. Ensembles perform very well in practice, winning many classical (i.e. non-deep-learning) machine learning competitions.\n",
    "- Weakness: One of the points of caution with ensemble models are over fitting although bagging largely takes care of it. With bagging, if base classifier is stable (not suffering from high variance), this method can actually make it worse. With Random Forests, drawback is that there is no interpretability in final model aside from variable importance. With boosting, If a classifier gets the higher weight observations wrong, it has a higher error rate. \n",
    "- Suitability: We can use Random Forests Ensemble method as it is computationally fast, and can handle the large number of input variables to make good classifiers with great accuracy. In addition, it will provide information on variable importance for the purposes of feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Logistic Regression:\n",
    "- Real world application: Logistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, most medical fields, and social sciences. Some examples are predicting mortality in injured patients, medical scales used to assess severity of a patient, predicting the risk of developing a given disease (e.g. diabetes; coronary heart disease), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.). In social sciences and engineering, it is used to predict voting behavior given demographic data, probability of failure of a given process, system or product, prediction of customer purchase probability, likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage, etc.\n",
    "- Strengths:  This method is robust, can handle  nonlinear effects and outputs have a nice probabilistic interpretation. The algorithm can also be regularized to avoid overfitting. Logistic models can be updated easily with new data using stochastic gradient descent.\n",
    "- Weakness: Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries. They are not flexible enough to naturally capture more complex relationships.\n",
    "- Suitability: We can use Logistic Regession because our ultimate prediction here is binary - donor or not. Hence, the technique is suitable for our project.\n",

    "- Gradient Boosting is a machine learning algorithm used for classification. It produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees and builds the model in a stage-wise fashion.\n",

    "- The models are based on features such as income, education level, marital status, etc. and form rules to forecast if income will be over 50000 dollars or not.\n",
    "- The intuition behind gradient boosting algorithm is to repetitively leverage the patterns in the initial models and then strengthen a model with weak predictions and make it better. Once we reach a stage that residuals do not have any pattern that could be modeled, we can stop modeling. \n"

    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "- In my opinion, of the thirteen available features, the following five are important for prediction.\n",
    "1. **Age** -  As age increases, so does experience and levels of position occupied. This translates to a higher income. While factors like liabilities (EMI,tax,etc.) and possible dependants also increase, it can be thought of as being countered by factors such as higher accumulated savings and less frivolous purchases.\n",
    "2. **Sex** - Disparities in income based on gender is prevalent in most countries of the world. Women generally earn less than men. So, I expect that this sample will also reflect the same trend. \n",
    "3. **Education Level** - As the education level increases, so do skills and opportunites. Thus, educational level should roughly be proportional to income.\n",
    "4. **Native-country** - Probability of people living in their native country is higher. So, I expect that economic health of native country to be roughly representative of individual income. That is people from developed nations are far more likely to have higher incomes. I am assuming that differences based on individuals who migrate will be leveled by education levels.\n",

However, it can be considered similar to some of the reasons I listed for age such as dependants, double incomes, shared expenses, more deliberate purchases and so on. In hindsight, seems like relevant factor as it is similar to the age factor."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
